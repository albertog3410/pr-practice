## Mr. Mueller's Ideal Afternoon

The best way to relax after a long day is hang out with your friends.
There are many activities you can do with your friends, such as:
- Gaming
- Going to movies
- Laugh
- Go to eat somewhere. Mr.Mueller's PREFERED snack for this it mint chocolate ice cream
If not, you can always have time with yourself just to relax or even hang out with family.
